# IteratedVirtual.SpiralEnergy

An intentionally modest “tension minimization” theorem:

We define a nonnegative discrete energy functional that measures deviation from the helix
constraints:
- unit radius in the x/y plane;
- z coordinate equal to `pitch * t`.

Then the helix point has energy `0`, hence minimizes this energy (pointwise, and by summing
over a list of samples).

This avoids heavy calculus-of-variations infrastructure while still giving a *proved* link
between the computed helix embedding and an explicit “tension” objective.

## “As k → ∞” (atTop) minimization statement

Since the helix achieves energy `0` at every parameter value, the sequence of energies along
integer samples is identically `0`, hence tends to `0` as `k → ∞`.
